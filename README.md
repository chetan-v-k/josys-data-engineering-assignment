# CLICKSTREAM SESSIONIZER

## PROBLEM UNDERSTANDING
The task is to process raw clickstream data generated by users and group the events into meaningful user sessions.

Each click event contains:
- a `user_id`
- a `timestamp` (Unix epoch time in seconds)

A session is defined as a sequence of events from the same user where the time gap between two consecutive
events does not exceed **30 minutes (1800 seconds)**.  
The input events are not guaranteed to be in chronological order.



## APPROACH AND DESIGN
1. Group all events by `user_id` since sessions are user-specific.
2. Sort the timestamps for each user because the input may be unsorted.
3. Iterate through the sorted events and create sessions based on the 30-minute inactivity rule.
4. For each session, store the start time, end time, and number of events.

This approach ensures correct session formation even when events arrive out of order.



## TOOLS / STACK USED
- **Language:** Python 3
- **Data Structures:** List, Dictionary
- **Libraries:** None (only standard Python features)



## TIME AND SPACE COMPLEXITY
- **Time Complexity:** O(N log N)  
  Sorting events per user dominates the runtime.
- **Space Complexity:** O(N)  
  Used to store grouped events and session results.

Where **N** is the total number of events.



## SAMPLE INPUT
```python
events = [
    ("user_A", 100),
    ("user_A", 110),
    ("user_B", 500),
    ("user_A", 2000),
    ("user_A", 120)
]


## RUNNING THE SCRIPT
```
python sessionizer.py
```

## PERFORMANCE
- Time Complexity: O(N log N) - Due to sorting events per user
- Space Complexity: O(N) - For storing events and results
